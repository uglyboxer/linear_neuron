{"name":"Linear neuron","tagline":"A basic one layer network of n - neurons to explore the implementation of backpropagation.","body":"This is a basic neural net made of linear neurons to explore basic machine learning techniques.  It was designed to analyze a portion of the handwritten digits from [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org) and make guesses as to the identity of the remaining elements of the set.  It has since been refactor to fit other test data sets.  You can read some of the lessons I learned in my [blog](https://uglyboxer.github.io).
